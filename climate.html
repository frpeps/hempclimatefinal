            <h2>Benefits of Hemp as a Carbon Sequester</h2>
            <p>Hemp is a versatile plant that helps mitigate climate change in many ways. Benefits of Hemp Include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rapid Growth:</strong> Hemp grows really fast, growing tall as 15ft in 3-4 months. This fast growth helps it trap large volumes of CO2 in the atmosphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil Health Improvement:</strong> Hemp has strong root stock that aids in soil aeration and water infiltration, also reducing soil erosion in the process. It also helps to improve fertility in the soil through the contribution of organic matter, thus promoting microbial life.</li>
                <li><strong>Renewable Resource:</strong> Hemp is used in textile, building construction, paper production, and bioenergy sector. Hemp can be used to replace non-renewable resources and cut the rate that fossil fuels are used.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon Credits:</strong> hemp farmers and companies responsible for growing the plant earn carbon credits in carbon markets. So, they can earn extra money exchanging these credits, which reflect their reduction of carbon emission. Sustainable practices are great, and financially viable.</li>
                <li><strong>Bioremediation:</strong> Hemp can take contaminants out of the soil, therefore, it can be used to clean up contaminated land while at the same time store carbon.</li>
            </ul>

   <h1>Hemp Fiber Details</h1>
    <img src="https://thehia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hemp-Stalk-showing-Bast-and-Hurd-smaller.png" alt="Hemp Fiber" />
    <p>Hemp fibers are considered an eco-friendly alternative to synthetic fibers and are biodegradable.</p>

    <h2>Main Parts of Hemp Fibers</h2>

    <h3>1. Bast Fiber</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Hemp stalk has long strong fibers in the center referred to as bast fibers. They contain cellulose, this helps create the hemp's durability.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> Bast fibers are primarily used in the production of textiles, ropes, and biodegradable composites. They are also used in making paper and packaging materials.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Tensile strength, resistance to mold and UV light, and the ability to absorb moisture

 <h3>2. Hurd </h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong>According to Hurd the inner core, or hurd, of the hemp stalk is made up of short, woody fibers. Processing bast fibers usually yield a by product that is often treated as waste material.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses: </strong>Hurd is also used in the construction material hempcrete (a sustainable building material). It can be used in mulch.</p>
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Hurd is lightweight, has good inside insulation and is highly absorbent, making it suitable for construction and agricultural applications.</p>



   <h3>3.Leaves</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> Parts that grow from the stalk, green, fan shaped.</p>
    <p><strong>Uses: </strong>Hemp leaves can be used for the Herbs, Teas and as a Compost source of nutrients. You can extract cannabinoids from hemp for medicinal use.
    <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong>Leaves are full of chlorophyl and other nutrients making it good for compost</p>




    <h3>4.Stalk</h3>
    <p><strong>Description:</strong> The stalk is the main stem of a hemp plant. </p>
    <p><strong>Uses:</strong> The stalk is used to make textiles and construction materials</p>

<p><strong>Characteristics:</strong> The stalk provides structural support to the plant.

            <h2>The Stigma Against Hemp</h2>
            <p>Even though it has many benefits, hemp faces stigma due to its association with marijuana. It's important to know the difference between hemp and marijuana to so that the wrong plant is not demonized.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Different Genes:</strong> Hemp and marijuana are different genetics of the Cannabis plant. Hemp contains very low levels of THC, the psychoactive compound found in marijuana, making it non-intoxicating, while marijuana contains THC, producing a high to those who use it.</li>
                <li><strong>Legal Status:</strong> Many countries have legalized hemp cultivation, and to some extent know its potential for sustainable development. But, in many of those countries marijuana is illegal, so stigmas still exist against the plant.</li>
                <li><strong>Awareness:</strong> Making it publicly known that hemp and marijuana are two completely different things when it comes to use. Maybe start rallies or give out information pamphlets like people trying to convert you at the train station.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="actions">
            <h2>Individual ways to Fight Against Stigma</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Politics:</strong> Support policies that are for hemp cultivation.</li>
                <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> Try to throw some events for the community with a goal of spreading awareness. This could be things like classes or town meeting presentations.</li>
                <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Work with other people/organizations that support your cause.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="fun-facts">
            <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Hemp can absorb up to 22 tons of CO2 per hectare in a year.</li>
                <li>Hemp produces more fiber per acre than trees, making it a new option for paper.</li>
                <li>Hemp needs less water than cotton, making it a more sustainable crop in water-scarce regions.</li>
                <li>Hamilton College was #20 on the list of “reefer madness colleges” put out in 2020/2021. But it is important to note this was not for hemp but rather psychoactive marijuana.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="sustainability">
            <h2>Hemp: A Solution for Sustainability</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Construction:</strong> Used as insulation material. Particle board and other composites use hemp in construction. Such materials are frequently more environmentally friendly than conventional materials, as well as offering improved insulation and decreasing energy use.</li>
                <li><strong>Biofuels:</strong> From hemp seeds, biodiesel can be manufactured, thereby conserving energy as opposed to the use of fossil fuel. This makes the energy systems more sustainable and reduces greenhouse gas emissions as desired.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Care Products:</strong> Hemp oil is used in cosmetics and personal care products since it’s moisturizing. They are usually free from synthetic materials making them eco-friendly products to the consumers on more responsible consumer products to use.</li>
            </ul>
